# Hi, I’m Kavin Siaw 👋  
Physics & Astronomy researcher | Python & Astropy | Time-domain data analysis

---

## About Me  
I am an undergraduate Physics major with an Astronomy emphasis, focused on time-domain astronomy and scientific computing.  
My toolkit includes Python, R, Mathematica, and I enjoy turning raw data into insights—whether it’s light curves, spectra, or simulations.

---

## What I Work On  
- **Time-Domain Astronomy** — variable stars, AGN/blazar variability, light-curve analysis  
- **Data Analysis & Scientific Computing** — pipelines, reproducible workflows, GUIs  
- **Cross-discipline Skills** — combining physics/astronomy intuition with code and statistics
